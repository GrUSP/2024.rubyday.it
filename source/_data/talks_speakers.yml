Some of them are annoying, some of them are fun and a few are actually quite useful. In this session we'll go over some of my favorite weird Ruby features and we'll discuss how to make the best use of them (provided they are any useful, that is). It will be weird and fun, I promise!"

Well, with 1.2 million websites worldwide built on Ruby on Rails, let’s harness the power of this popular framework to implement intelligent recommendations effortlessly! This talk will explore the exciting realm of recommendation systems and how to build an intelligent system using Ruby on Rails. We will start by unraveling the fundamentals of recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering. With this foundation, we will integrate machine learning techniques into the Ruby on Rails framework. Throughout the talk, we will discuss various strategies for capturing and utilizing user preferences, improving recommendation accuracy, and continuously refining the system based on user feedback. By the end of this talk, you will have gained valuable insights into building an intelligent system that can transform raw data into valuable recommendations within a Ruby on Rails application!"

        talk_description: "With the ZIRP (zero-interest rates policy) period behind us, the IT at large - and web / SaaS slice of it in particular - is facing interesting times. Smaller teams (or even single devs) will need to deliver leaner solutions, and projects like LiteStack show us an enticingly minimalist environments.
        Let’s take a look how simple modern stacks can be - from dynamic sites build with backend-generated HTML-over-websockets through database-backed job queues and production uses of SQLite."
